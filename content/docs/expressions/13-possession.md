# Omistus - Possession 💰

## Possession Structure (minulla on)

Finnish expresses possession using the structure **-lla/-llä + on** (literally "at me there is").

This is different from English, where we say "I have." In Finnish, you say "at me there is."

### Positive Form

| Person     | Structure  | English           |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| minulla on | I have     | I have            |
| sinulla on | you have   | you have          |
| hänellä on | he/she has | he/she has        |
| meillä on  | we have    | we have           |
| teillä on  | you have   | you (plural) have |
| heillä on  | they have  | they have         |

### Negative Form (-lla/-llä + ei ole + Partitive)

| Person         | Structure           | English                 |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| minulla ei ole | I don't have        | I don't have            |
| sinulla ei ole | you don't have      | you don't have          |
| hänellä ei ole | he/she doesn't have | he/she doesn't have     |
| meillä ei ole  | we don't have       | we don't have           |
| teillä ei ole  | you don't have      | you (plural) don't have |
| heillä ei ole  | they don't have     | they don't have         |

**Important:** In negative sentences, the object changes to partitive case.
