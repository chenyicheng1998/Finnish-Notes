## What is Vowel Harmony?

Vowel harmony is a fundamental rule in Finnish where vowels within a word must belong to the same group. This affects word endings and suffixes.

## Vowel Groups

Finnish vowels are divided into three groups:

### Back Vowels (后元音)
- **a, o, u**

### Neutral Vowels (中立元音)
- **e, i**

### Front Vowels (前元音)
- **ä, ö, y**

## The Rule

- A word with **back vowels** (a, o, u) takes endings with back vowels
- A word with **front vowels** (ä, ö, y) takes endings with front vowels
- **Neutral vowels** (e, i) can appear with either group

## Examples

### Back vowel words:
- auto → auto**ssa** (in the car)
- talo → talo**ssa** (in the house)

### Front vowel words:
- käsi → käde**ssä** (in the hand)
- yö → yö**ssä** (in the night)

### Mixed with neutral vowels:
- keittiö → keittiö**ssä** (in the kitchen) - front vowels dominate
- tie → tie**llä** (on the road) - neutral vowels use front endings

## Important Note

You cannot mix back and front vowels in the same word (except for compound words and loan words).

**Practice Tip:**
When learning new words, pay attention to which vowel group they belong to. This will help you use correct endings.
